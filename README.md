# Linear Regression in Python Example

## Overview

The goal of this project is to work through a standard Data Science workflow: exploring data, building models, making predictions, and evaluating results. We will do this using a simple linear least squares model on two datasets: the **Iris dataset** and the **Auto MPG dataset**.

## Datasets

### Iris Dataset
- Describes various species of iris flowers.
- Features include:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
  - Species classification

### Auto MPG Dataset
- Contains details of different US cars.
- Features include:
  - Miles per gallon (MPG)
  - Cylinders
  - Displacement
  - Horsepower
  - Weight
  - Acceleration
  - Model year

## Key Features

- Data exploration and visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Linear regression modeling using Scikit-learn.
- Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the required Python libraries.
3. Open the `Linear Regression IRIS data.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis and results.
